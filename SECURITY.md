# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security and bug fixes are generally provided only for the last minor version. Fixes are released either as part of the next minor version or as an on-demand patch version.

Security fixes are given priority and might be enough to cause a new version to be released.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We encourage responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities. If you find something suspicious, we encourage and appreciate your report!

In order for the vulnerability reports to reach maintainers as soon as possible, the preferred way is to use the "Report a vulnerability" button under the "Security" tab of this project.
This creates a private communication channel between the reporter and the maintainers.

Alternatively, please reach out to the Codezero security team at [security@codezero.io](mailto:security@codezero.io).
